- "Amongst engineering other projects, handling staffing, and marketing; I am working on my PhD in Medicine with the University of Sydney. There I am inventing medical devices and engineering software to facilitate large-scale screening programmes."
- "Glaucoma afflicts 1-2% of the worldwide population, making it the leading cause of permanent blindness. Unfortunately [worldwide] there have only been 11 population studies on Glaucoma in the past 50 years, with a total of 34,478 surveyed. In Australia over 50% of sufferers go undiagnosed."
- "Being a computer scientist I was shocked by these miniscule studies!"
- "Compare this to all the popular social-networking companies which run AI algorithms against databases containing billions of profiles. So let’s do the same in medicine."
- "Plan to start by screening 1 million Australians [during this research degree], with scope—i.e.: more than Glaucoma—and population sizes set to grow in the succeeding years."
- "Down to specifics. I am working in ophthalmology on developing indirect ophthalmoscopes—attaching them to smartphones—authoring smartphone apps and web-frontends to contain patient records (including the fundus images), architecting backends and engineering machine learning algorithms atop convolutional neural networks."
- "The platform must handle everything from CI/CD pipelining to database clustering to running distributed frameworks (e.g.: for machine learning)."
- "To enable these workflows on scalable multifarious infrastructures at huge scale; [especially] with only one engineer; straightforward standardised approaches are required."
- "The technology stack centres around: Mesos to handle resource allocation, container orchestration via Marathon, and Chronos for schedule handling; to easily leverage Spark [and similar] to run experiments and improve diagnoses [at scale], without having to worry about data locality and compute utilisation efficiency."
- "Planning various key [open-source] contributions to the OpenDCOS project, starting with implementing support for:"
- "0) 52 private/public clouds"
- "1) Consul and Etcd alternatives to Zookeeper"
- "OpenDCOS empowers battle-tested design-patterns without the barrier-to-entry of creating and maintaining one's own Mesos-based distribution."
